## Description

A blog site where developers can publish blog posts and comment on other developersâ€™ posts. This app follows the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, using Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication. Built from scratch and deployed to Heroku.

## Installation

The following necessary dependencies must be installed to run the application properly:

- This Generator assumes you have a 'complete dev environment' setup - a terminal, Node, & VS Code. To get started, Fork the repository and clone the new repo from your Github to your local computer. `cd` into the cloned repo and enter: `npm i`

- [![code style: prettier](https://img.shields.io/badge/code_style-prettier-ff69b4.svg?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/prettier/prettier)
- Various VS Code 'settings' and 'extensions.' Look in the bottom right when you open this up in VS Code to install them.

## Usage

Once you `cd` into the repo, run `npm i` to install all the things. You can then start the server by executing `node server.js`. In order to seed the database, execute `node seeds/seed.js`. Use an app like Insomnia Core to test your CRUD opperations on the database.
