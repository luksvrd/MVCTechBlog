## Description

A blog site where developers can publish blog posts and comment on other developers’ posts. This app follows the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, using Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication. Built from scratch and deployed to Heroku.

## Installation

The following necessary dependencies must be installed to run the application properly:

- This Generator assumes you have a 'complete dev environment' setup - a terminal, Node, & VS Code. To get started, Fork the repository and clone the new repo from your Github to your local computer. `cd` into the cloned repo and enter: `npm i`

- [![code style: prettier](https://img.shields.io/badge/code_style-prettier-ff69b4.svg?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/prettier/prettier)
- Various VS Code 'settings' and 'extensions.' Look in the bottom right when you open this up in VS Code to install them.

## Usage

Once you `cd` into the repo, run `npm i` to install all the things. You can then start the server by executing `node server.js`. In order to seed the database, execute `node seeds/seed.js`. Use an app like Insomnia Core to test your CRUD opperations on the database.
